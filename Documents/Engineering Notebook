October 6. Met with PHD student on the project to discuss roles. We talked about purchasing new optics and laser diode to increase power at the receiver. The plan is to install a 1 kOhm resistor on laser driver to increase the transmitted power. 
October 11. Researched plans for amplification at receiver end. I need to know more about the signal coming from the receiver in order to design an amplifier. 
October 12. Virtually met with my team to discuss Sprint 1 presentation and create power point. 
October 13. Presented to class about the project and Sprint 1.
October 21. Added 1 kOhm resistor to laser driver. This increased power output substantially. We are now able to get up to 8-10 mW. 
October 24. Spoke to PhD student working on project to figure out receiver issues. Plan to meet this week.

Sept 29. Continued work on documentation.
Oct 6. Met with PHD students regarding the project. Established tasks, roles, and overview for the next two sprints. 
Oct 13. Presented first sprint of project to class.
Oct 21. Soldered in the 1kOhm resistor to the laser driver. Allows for increase output power to drive the diode. 
Oct 25. Worked on second sprint documentation.  
Oct 27. Worked to diagnose the current reciever. Begun research on future recievers. 
Nov 1. Worked on Test Plan documentation
Nov 3. Further research and final decision on next reciever. 
Nov 16. Worked on Sprint 2 Demos. 
Nov 29. Installed new photodiode reciever and Raspberry Pi transmitter. Began testing modulated signals. Ended up accidentally shorting our driver and diodes.
Dec 1. Attempted to install secondary laser driver, unfortunately it was the orignial driver from the previous group, already broken. 
Dec 6. Attempted to test laser diodes with backup laser drvier. Contacted customer to purchase new equipment. 

Sean Huber's section:

Sep 16 - Showed up to the lab, got an introduction to the materials and working are.

Sep 22 - We realize we really have no idea what we are doing. Attempted to focus the diode but it’s clear research is needed but was able to measure 50% diode power at a few inches away.
Sep 27 – Started SDS Document outline
Oct 6 – Discussed plans for purchasing optics and new laser driver and/or laser diode to increase power to overcome the losses due to the given optics. The current plan is to install a 1K ohm resistor in the laser driver to increase the laser power to increase the delivered current from .5ma to 2.5ma.
Oct 12 – Virtual meeting on discord to discuss and complete the SDS V1 document
Oct 13 – Presented to the class sprint 1. Which contained what we had/have not accomplished
Oct 21 – Install and test of the 1K ohm resistor in the driver. With the resistor installed the diode can reach power levels of 10mw. Next is to research and order optics to focus the now intensified beam.
Oct 25 – Met in LB 274, updating documents and discussing the next step and delegating tasks. 
Oct 27 – Met at the micaplex to diagnose the reciever. 
Nov 1 - Met at LB274, determined team assignments for test plan.
Nov 3 - Micaplex to attempt any other ways to get the reciever to work and discuss new reciever
Nov 12 - Started working on setting up the Raspis with a SSH and FTP sevrer for remote access and execution
Nov 16 - Started static tests for serial communication with the Raspis.
Nov 22 - Developed test code to experiment with the raspi Serial communication standards
Nov 29 - Micaplex - installed and verified the new reciever works, used the raspi to send some serial data to see it on the osilliscope. Ended up killing the laser driver due to unproteced wire connections.
Dec 1 - Micaplex - Tried the secondary laser driver, was told working, discovered it was also burntout as from the previous year. Need to order new diodes and laser drivers.
